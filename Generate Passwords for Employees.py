# Generate Passwords for Employees
# There are N employees working in a company. The N employees are numbered from 1 to N. Every day, each employee must use a password to enter into the office. The passwords of the employees are generated based on the following conditions.
# - The password of Kth employee on the 1st day = C+K, where C is a numeric value representing the company's code.
# - The password of Kth employee on the 2nd day = Password[day1] of Kth employee + C + 1.
# - The password of Kth employee on the 3rd day = Password[day2] of Kth employee + C + 2.
# - The password of Kth employee on the 4th day = Password[day3] of Kth employee+ C + 3.
# - Similarly, the passwords are generated for the remaining days.
# The program must accept the values of N and C as the input. The program must print the passwords of the N employees on each day from 1 to D as the output. The value of D is also passed as the input.

# Boundary Condition(s):
# 1 <= N <= 1000
# 1 <= C <= 10^5
# 1 <= D <= 100

# Input Format:
# The first line contains N.
# The second line contains C.
# The third line contains D.

# Output Format:
# The first D lines, each contains N integers separated by a space representing the passwords of the N employees.

# Example Input/Output 1:
# Input:
# 10
# 500
# 3

# Output:
# 501 502 503 504 505 506 507 508 509 510
# 1002 1003 1004 1005 1006 1007 1008 1009 1010 1011
# 1504 1505 1506 1507 1508 1509 1510 1511 1512 1513

# Explanation:
# Here N = 10, C = 500 and D = 3.
# Passwords of the 10 employees on day 1: 501 502 503 504 505 506 507 508 509 510
# Passwords of the 10 employees on day 2: 1002 1003 1004 1005 1006 1007 1008 1009 1010 1011
# Passwords of the 10 employees on day 3: 1504 1505 1506 1507 1508 1509 1510 1511 1512 1513

# Example Input/Output 2:
# Input:
# 7
# 120
# 6

# Output:
# 121 122 123 124 125 126 127
# 242 243 244 245 246 247 248
# 364 365 366 367 368 369 370
# 487 488 489 490 491 492 493
# 611 612 613 614 615 616 617
# 736 737 738 739 740 741 742
