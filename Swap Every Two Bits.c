// # Swap Every Two Bits
// # The program must accept an integer N as the input. The program must swap every two bits in the binary representation of N from LSB and print the revised value of N as the output. If the number of bits in the binary representation of N is odd, then consider a leading zero in its binary representation to swap every two bits. Please fill in the blanks with code so that the program runs successfully.

// # Boundary Condition(s):
// # 1 <= N < 2^8

// # Input Format:
// # The first line contains N.

// # Output Format:
// # The first line contains the revised value of N.

// # Example Input/Output 1:
// # Input:
// # 218

// # Output:
// # 229

// # Explanation:
// # The binary representation of 218 is 11011010.
// # After swapping every two bits in the binary representation of 218, the binary representation becomes 11100101.
// # The decimal equivalent of 11100101 is 229 which is printed as the output.

// # Example Input/Output 2:
// # Input:
// # 154

// # Output:
// # 101

// # Example Input/Output 3:
// # Input:
// # 7

// # Output:
// # 11

// # Explanation:
// # The binary representation of 7 is 0111.
// # After swapping every two bits in the binary representation of 7, the binary representation becomes 1011.
// # The decimal equivalent of 1011 is 11 which is printed as the output.
