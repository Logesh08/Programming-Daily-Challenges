# Binary Submatrices to Integers
# The program must accept an integer matrix of size R*C and an integer K as the input. The matrix contains only 0s and 1s. The values of R and C are always divisible by K. For each K*K submatrix, the program must print an integer whose binary representation is formed using the bits in the submatrix.

# Boundary Condition(s):
# 2 <= R, C <= 50
# 1 <= K <= 5

# Input Format:
# The first line contains R and C separated by a space.
# The next R lines each contains C integer values separated by a space.
# The R+2nd line contains K.

# Output Format:
# The first R/K lines, each contains C/K integer values separated by a space.

# Example Input/Output 1:
# Input:
# 4 4
# 1 0 0 1
# 1 1 0 1
# 1 1 0 1
# 1 0 1 0
# 2

# Output:
# 11 5
# 14 6

# Explanation:
# 1st submatrix -> 1011 -> 11.
# 2nd submatrix -> 0101 -> 5.
# 3rd submatrix -> 1110 -> 14.
# 4th submatrix -> 0110 -> 6.
# Hence the output is
# 11 5
# 14 6

# Example Input/Output 2:
# Input:
# 6 9
# 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1
# 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0
# 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1
# 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0
# 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0
# 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1
# 3

# Output:
# 72 475 103
# 142 217 311
