# Super Binary String
# The program must accept a string S containing only 0s and 1s as the input. The program must print Yes if the given string is a super binary string. Else the program must print No as the output. A super binary string must satisfy the following two conditions.
# - The number of 1s must be equal to the number of 0s.
# - In each prefix of the string, the number of 1s must be greater than or equal to the number of 0s in the prefix.

# Hint: Optimize your logic to avoid Time Limit Exceeded Error.

# Boundary Condition(s):
# 1 <= Length of S <= 10^6

# Input Format:
# The first line contains S.

# Output Format:
# The first line contains Yes or No.

# Example Input/Output 1:
# Input:
# 110010

# Output:
# Yes

# Explanation:
# Here S = "110010".
# The number of 1s in S = 3.
# The number of 0s in S = 3.
# In each prefix of S, the number of 1s is greater than or equal to the number of 0s.
# 1st prefix: 1
# 2nd prefix: 11
# 3rd prefix: 110
# 4th prefix: 1100
# 5th prefix: 11001
# 6th prefix: 110010
# Hence Yes is printed as the output.

# Example Input/Output 2:
# Input:
# 1001

# Output:
# No

# Example Input/Output 3:
# Input:
# 11010

# Output:
# No
