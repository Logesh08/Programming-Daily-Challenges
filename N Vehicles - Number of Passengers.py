# N Vehicles - Number of Passengers
# The capacity of N vehicles are passed as the input. The program must print the number of passengers who can travel in such a way that the occupied vehicles are filled to their capacity. The output containing the number of passengers must be sorted.

# Boundary Condition(s):
# 1 <= N <= 10
# 1 <= Capacity of each vehicle <= 1000

# Input Format:
# The first line contains N.
# The second line contains N integer values separated by a space representing the capacity of N vehicles.

# Output Format:
# The first line contains the integer values separated by a space representing the number of passengers.

# Example Input/Output 1:
# Input:
# 3
# 5 4 10

# Output:
# 4 5 9 10 14 15 19

# Explanation:
# When just 1 vehicle alone is used the filled capacity is 4, 5 and 10.
# When Vehicle 1 and 2 are filled, the count of passengers is 9.
# When Vehicle 1 and 3 are filled, the count of passengers is 15.
# Similarly, for Vehicle 2 and 3 it is 14.
# When all three vehicles are filled, the count is 19.
# The output is these count of passengers sorted in ascending order.

# Example Input/Output 2:
# Input:
# 4
# 14 5 10 20

# Output:
# 5 10 14 15 19 20 24 25 29 30 34 35 39 44 49
