# If two or more employees have the same working time then those employees must be printed in chronological order based on their in-time.
# If two or more employees have the same working time and the same in-time then those employees must be printed in sorted order based on their names.

# Boundary Condition(s):
# 1 <= N <= 50
# 1 <= Length of each employee's name <= 10

# Input Format:
