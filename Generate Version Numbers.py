# Generate Version Numbers
# The program must accept two characters ch1, ch2 and two integers X, Y as the input. The characters ch1 and ch2 represent a range of alphabets. The integers X and Y represent a range of integers. The program must generate the version numbers based on the following conditions.
# - The version number must have three parts separated by a dot (part1.part2.part3).
# - The part1 must be formed using the combination of an alphabet and an integer.
# - The part2 must be formed using only the alphabet.
# - The part3 must be formed using only the integer.
# The program must print all possible version numbers that can be formed using the given alphabet range and integer range in sorted order.

# Boundary Condition(s):
# 1 <= X < Y <= 20

# Input Format:
# The first line contains ch1 and ch2.
# The second line contains X and Y.

# Output Format:
# The lines contain all the possible version numbers that can be formed.

# Example Input/Output 1:
# Input:
# a b
# 1 2

# Output:
# a1.a.1
# a1.a.2
# a1.b.1
# a1.b.2
# a2.a.1
# a2.a.2
# a2.b.1
# a2.b.2
# b1.a.1
# b1.a.2
# b1.b.1
# b1.b.2
# b2.a.1
# b2.a.2
# b2.b.1
# b2.b.2

# Explanation:
# Here the given two alphabets are a, b and the given two integers are 1, 2.
# All possible version numbers that can be formed using the given alphabet range and integer range are printed as the output.

# Example Input/Output 2:
# Input:
# x y
# 7 9

# Output:
# x7.x.7
# x7.x.8
# x7.x.9
# x7.y.7
# x7.y.8
# x7.y.9
# x8.x.7
# x8.x.8
# x8.x.9
# x8.y.7
# x8.y.8
# x8.y.9
# x9.x.7
# x9.x.8
