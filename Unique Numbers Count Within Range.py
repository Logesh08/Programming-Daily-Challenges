# Unique Numbers Count Within Range
# Given N numbers, the program must find and print the count C of the distinct(unique) numbers which are within a given range inclusive of R1 and R2.

# Input Format:
# The first line contains N, R1 and R2 separated by a space.
# The second line contains N positive integers separated by a space.

# Output Format:
# The first line contains the count C.

# Boundary Conditions:
# 1 <= N <= 9999
# 1 <= R1, R2 <= 999999
# R1 <= R2

# Example Input/Output 1:
# Input:
# 7 19 44
# 100 19 51 32 41 89 32

# Output:
# 3

# Explanation:
# The three unique numbers within the given range (19 to 44 inclusive) are 19, 32 and 41.
