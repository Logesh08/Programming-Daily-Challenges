# Expand Matrix - Vertically/Horizontally
# The program must accept a character matrix of size R*C and an integer K as the input. The program must expand the matrix horizontally so that each character in the rows repeated K times if K is positive. Else the program must expand the matrix vertically so that each character in the columns repeated K times. Finally, the program must print the expanded matrix as the output.

# Note: The value of K is always a nonzero value.

# Boundary Condition(s):
# 1 <= R, C <= 50
# -50 <= K <= 50

# Input Format:
# The first line contains R and C separated by a space.
# The next R lines, each contains C characters separated by a space.
# The R+2nd line contains K.

# Output Format:
# The lines contain the expanded matrix based on the given conditions.

# Example Input/Output 1:
# Input:
# 3 3
# a b c
# d e f
# g h i
# 4

# Output:
# a a a a b b b b c c c c
# d d d d e e e e f f f f
# g g g g h h h h i i i i

# Explanation:
# Here K = 4, which is a positive value.
# So the matrix is expanded horizontally as given below.
# a a a a b b b b c c c c
# d d d d e e e e f f f f
# g g g g h h h h i i i i

# Example Input/Output 2:
# Input:
# 3 3
# A B C
# P Q R
# X Y Z
# -4

# Output:
# A B C
# A B C
# A B C
# A B C
# P Q R
# P Q R
# P Q R
# P Q R
# X Y Z
# X Y Z
# X Y Z
# X Y Z
