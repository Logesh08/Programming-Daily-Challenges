# Horizontally Concatenated Triangles
# The program must accept a string S of odd length as the input. The program must print the horizontally concatenated triangle pattern of the string S based on the following conditions.
# - The first triangle must be formed using all L characters of S, where L = length of the string S.
# - The second triangle must be formed using the first L-2 characters of S.
# - The third triangle must be formed using the first L-3 characters of S.
# - Similarly, the remaining triangles must be formed and printed horizontally.
# The empty spaces between the triangles must be printed as asterisks.

# Boundary Condition(s):
# 3 <= Length of S <= 49

# Input Format:
# The first line contains S.

# Output Format:
# The first (L+1)/2 lines contain the horizontally concatenated triangle pattern based on the given conditions.

# Example Input/Output 1:
# Input:
# hello

# Output:
# **h
# *hel**h
# hellohelh

# Explanation:
# Here S = "hello".
# The 1st triangle is formed using all 5 characters.
# **h
# *hel
# hello

# The 2nd triangle is formed using the first 3 characters.
# *h
# hel

# The 3rd triangle is formed using the first character.
# h

# So the three triangles are printed horizontally.

# Example Input/Output 2:
# Input:
# SkillRack

# Output:
# ****S
# ***Ski******S
# **Skill****Ski****S
# *SkillRa**Skill**Ski**S
# SkillRackSkillRaSkillSkiS
